# Welcome to Pingfence 👋

At Pingfence, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right for everyone, and it shouldn't come with a hefty price tag. To bridge this gap, we've pledged to develop high-quality, low-cost, and sustainable security software products. Our mission is to depreciate the global cybercrime cost and increase user awareness of upcoming cyber threats by leveraging state-of-the-art technologies.
